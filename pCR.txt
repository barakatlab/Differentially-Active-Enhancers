 #### pCR table is created like below:  
   
   - first: merged all regions and count each merged region. 
   bedtools merge -i `regions` -o count > first.bed
   - second: find the overlap between all regions.
   genomecoverage -i `regions` -g -bg > second.bed
   - third : intersect first and second files. 
   intersectBed -a first.bed -b second.bed -wa -wb > intersected_file1_file2.bed 
   then extracted maximum fragment that made the overlap region for each group based on coordinate of merged file.
