# Differentially-Active-Enhancers
Here we performed an integrative computational analysis of virtually all currently
available epigenome data sets related to human fetal brain. 

### Codes:
 - Part1 = Filtering data and defining DAEs and nDAEs.
 - Part2 = Enrichment analysis on DAEs and nDAEs.
 - Part3 = Enrichment analysis on 10 bps bin of DAEs and nDAEs.
 - Part4 = Clustring analysis.
